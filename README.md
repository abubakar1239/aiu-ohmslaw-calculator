🧮 Ohm’s Law Calculator

A simple and interactive Ohm’s Law Calculator that allows users to compute one electrical parameter (Voltage, Current, or Resistance) when the other two are provided.
This tool is helpful for electronics students, hobbyists, and anyone wanting quick circuit calculations.


---

⚡ Features

Calculate Voltage (V), Current (I), or Resistance (R)

Enter any two parameters, and the calculator automatically computes the missing value

User-friendly interface

Instant, accurate results

Built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript



---

🧩 How It Works

Ohm’s Law states:

V = I × R
I = V ÷ R
R = V ÷ I

✔ Supported Calculations

Enter Current & Resistance → get Voltage

Enter Voltage & Resistance → get Current

Enter Voltage & Current → get Resistance
